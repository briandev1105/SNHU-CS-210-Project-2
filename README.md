Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. 

This project was a interest calculator that would display interest accrued with and without monthly payments based on principal and how many years the investment lasted and based on user input. The problem that this program was solving was showing how investing monthly and significantly improve return on investment from interest accrued.  

What did you do particularly well? 

I think I did well on the functionality of outputting the menu options and collecting input as well as calling a function to make the calculations.  

 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? 

I think where I could have enhanced my code was solving how to collect validating user input more efficiently. 

 

Which pieces of code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? 

The most challenging part of this project was getting the calculations perfect due to rounding errors in the loop statements.  

 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 

The way I am able to make this program maintainable and reable is by employing Object Oriented Programming principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction. I also utilized inline comments to note exactly the functionality and purpose for each line of code.
